## How to Use This Handbook

This handbook is for the person who will actually run the workshops. You have read (or have access to) the Pattern Discovery Toolkit, the four appendices, the twenty living experience guides, and the proxemic integration supplement. Those documents describe *what* to do and *why*. This handbook tells you *how*, *when*, *where*, and *in what order*.

It is organized as a year — your first year of full programming. By the end of this year, every target group will have been served, all four appendices will have been activated, the pattern language will have its first entries, and the quality framework will have its first evaluation data.

# PART ONE: The Annual Programming Calendar

## The Erdpuls Seasonal Rhythm

The campus operates on a four-season cycle that shapes which workshops are possible, which are optimal, and which require adaptation:

| Season | Campus Rhythm | Dominant Theme |
|---|---|---|
| **Frühling** (March–May) | Pflanzen und Planen | New growth, first observations, outdoor work begins |
| **Sommer** (June–August) | Wachsen und Sammeln | Full biodiversity, residency period, outdoor workshops peak |
| **Herbst** (September–November) | Verarbeiten und Bewahren | Harvest, processing, cross-border exchange, elder knowledge |
| **Winter** (December–February) | Reparieren und Reflektieren | Indoor focus, repair, reflection, data synthesis, planning |

## The Year at a Glance

* * *

## Sequencing Logic

The calendar follows these principles:

**1. Adults first, then children.** The spring adults/families workshops (A.2, B.2) establish community familiarity with the Erdpuls approach before school groups arrive. Parents who have attended may then send children with prior context.

**2. Simple before complex.** Within each target group, the Soil protocol (Appendix A) precedes the Token Economy (B), which precedes Bioregion Mapping (C), which precedes Quality Evaluation (D). Each builds on the capacities developed by the previous.

**3. Residency in summer.** The longest, deepest engagement (artist/researcher) occupies the season with maximum landscape legibility, longest daylight, and most comfortable outdoor working conditions. The resident's four guide sessions (A.4, B.4, C.4, D.4) are distributed across the residency period.

**4. Cross-border in autumn.** The harvest season provides natural content for cross-border exchange (shared meal from shared landscape), and the agricultural cycle makes land-use patterns maximally visible.

**5. Elders in late autumn/winter.** Indoor-focused formats suit the season. The elder guides depend on memory and storytelling rather than outdoor physical activity. The Kaffee und Kuchen atmosphere aligns with the contemplative winter rhythm.

**6. Quality and synthesis in winter.** Reflection and evaluation happen when outdoor programming pauses. The year's accumulated data is synthesized, the Quality Report compiled, and Year 2 planned.

# PART TWO: Workshop Preparation Checklists

## Universal Checklist (applies to every workshop)

### 2 Weeks Before
- [ ] Confirm date, time, and participant numbers
- [ ] Confirm co-facilitator(s) and adult accompaniment (for children's/cross-border workshops)
- [ ] Read the relevant Living Experience Guide in full
- [ ] Read the corresponding Proxemic Supplement
- [ ] Conduct a Proxemic Audit of the planned session (see template below)
- [ ] Order/prepare consumable materials (pH strips, filter paper, worksheets)
- [ ] Check Boden-Koffer inventory and restock as needed
- [ ] For GIS workshops: update QGIS project with latest data layers
- [ ] For cross-border workshops: confirm transport, partner organization, bilingual facilitator

### 1 Day Before
- [ ] Print all participant materials (field sheets, worksheets, cards)
- [ ] Charge electronic devices (GPS, tablets, camera, audio recorder)
- [ ] Prepare the physical space: seating arrangement, table layout, display materials
- [ ] Set up refreshments (always: water; for elders: full Kaffee und Kuchen; for cross-border: shared meal provisions)
- [ ] Walk the planned route (for transect workshops) and check for hazards
- [ ] Test the projector/screen (for GIS workshops)
- [ ] Lay out materials in the order they will be used
- [ ] Review the Proxemic Audit: which phases need sensory anchors (objects to touch at social/public distance phases)?

### Day Of — Before Participants Arrive
- [ ] Final space check: is the opening arrangement sociopetal or sociofugal as required?
- [ ] For outdoor workshops: check weather and prepare contingency (rain plan, sun protection)
- [ ] Set the emotional tone: the space should feel welcoming, not institutional. Music during setup (optional). Flowers or greenery on tables. The smell of coffee if elders are coming.

### After the Workshop
- [ ] Photograph all produced materials (pattern cards, maps, worksheets, posters)
- [ ] Archive photographs and worksheets in the documentation system
- [ ] Enter GPS tracks and transition data into the QGIS project
- [ ] Enter token activities into the token ledger
- [ ] Write a brief facilitator reflection (15 min): What worked? What didn't? What would I change? What proxemic observations did I make? — This becomes BNE Area 5.2.1 evidence (continuous practice reflection).
- [ ] Clean and restock equipment. Return Boden-Koffer to its shelf.

## The Proxemic Audit Template

*Complete this for every workshop, as part of the 2-weeks-before preparation.*

| Phase # | Phase Name | Duration | Proxemic Zone (Intimate / Personal / Social / Public) | Sensory Channels Active (T=touch, S=smell, Th=thermal, A=auditory, V=visual) | Arrangement (Sociopetal / Sociofugal / Mixed) | Vertical (Level / Facilitator above / Participant above) | Sensory Anchor Object | Cross-Cultural Mediation Needed? |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | | | | | | | | |
| 2 | | | | | | | | |
| 3 | | | | | | | | |
| 4 | | | | | | | | |
| 5 | | | | | | | | |
| 6 | | | | | | | | |

**Check:** Are there 3+ consecutive phases at Social/Public distance with ≤2 channels? If yes → insert a hands-on, sensory-reactivation phase between them.

**Check:** Does every Social/Public phase have a Sensory Anchor Object prepared? If no → prepare one (a soil sample, a rock, a tool, a plant, a piece of bread).

# PART FOUR: Spatial Design Guide for the Five Zones

## Proxemic Design of the Erdpuls Campus

Each of the five campus zones has a proxemic character that shapes what kinds of learning happen naturally within it. This section provides spatial design guidance for each zone, drawing on the sociopetal/sociofugal distinction and the proxemic audit framework.

### Zone A — Circular Economy Workshop (Repair Café, Precious Plastic, Textile)

**Proxemic character:** Strongly sociopetal. The shared worktable is the center of gravity — participants gather around it, pass tools and materials hand-to-hand, diagnose problems collaboratively. The Repair Café table is the toolkit's primary site of personal-distance economic exchange.

**Spatial design recommendations:**
- Central large table (minimum 1.2 × 2.4 m) at standing-work height (90–95 cm). Participants stand around all four sides — no "front" or "back."
- Tools displayed on open pegboard (visual access from any position — sociopetal).
- Avoid enclosed workstations or individual benches — these create sociofugal islands.
- The Precious Plastic machines occupy one wall but face inward toward the shared space.
- Token card station near the exit: participants fill in token cards as they leave, reflecting on what elements their repair activity generated.

**Proxemic profile:** Intimate (hands-on repair) to Personal (collaborative diagnosis). All sensory channels active: touch (materials), smell (heated plastic, old electronics), thermal (heat gun, iron), auditory (tool sounds, conversation), visual (close inspection).

### Zone B — Bio-Materials Garden Laboratory

**Proxemic character:** Mixed — depends on the activity. Individual garden beds are sociofugal (each person faces their own row). Communal harvest areas, the washing station, and the Boden-Labor outdoor stations are sociopetal.

**Spatial design recommendations:**
- Permanent soil observation stations (3–4 across the garden) marked with posts. Each station has a different soil type or microclimate. These are the sites where Ring 2 observations occur.
- A central gathering area (gravel circle, bench ring, or simple cleared space) for group briefings before dispersal. This is the sociopetal anchor of Zone B.
- Boden-Koffer storage at the edge of the garden — weatherproof, unlocked during workshops.
- The garden path should pass through multiple micro-transitions (cultivated → wild → wet → dry → shaded → open) — these are the training transitions for Ring 2 pattern discovery.

**Proxemic profile:** Intimate (soil handling, plant contact) to Social (garden overview). Full sensory spectrum when close to the ground; vision-dominant when standing and surveying.

### Zone C — IoT & Electronics Workshop

**Proxemic character:** Tends sociofugal. Workbenches with individual solder stations, screens, and components create isolated attention bubbles.

**Spatial design recommendations:**
- At least one large central table for collaborative sensor-building sessions. When groups are building senseBox kits together, the work should be at this shared table, not at individual workstations.
- The sensor dashboard display (screen or projector) should be visible from the shared table — so that the "sensor dialogue" (body measurement vs. instrument measurement) can happen in a sociopetal arrangement.
- Component bins on open shelving (visible, accessible) rather than in closed drawers (hidden, individual).

**Proxemic profile:** Personal (soldering, close-up work) to Social (screen display, group discussion). Visual and haptic channels dominant; auditory channel carries instruction.

### Zone D — Digital Fabrication

**Proxemic character:** Machine-centered, tends sociofugal. Each machine (3D printer, laser cutter, CNC) demands individual attention.

**Spatial design recommendations:**
- Separate the design phase (collaborative, sociopetal) from the fabrication phase (individual, sociofugal). A shared CAD design table or projection screen for collaborative design review before anyone approaches a machine.
- Display finished objects from past workshops prominently — these are touchable artifacts that maintain intimate/personal proxemic engagement in an otherwise social/public-distance environment.
- Material samples (recycled filament, bio-materials from Zone B) on a handling table — participants should touch, bend, smell the materials before designing with them.

**Proxemic profile:** Personal (machine operation) to Social (design review). Visual-dominant during fabrication; multi-sensory when handling materials.

### Zone E — Heritage & Community Hub

**Proxemic character:** Strongly sociopetal. This is the Erzählcafé, the Wisdom Circle, the shared meal, the Memory Market. Every spatial arrangement should draw people inward.

**Spatial design recommendations:**
- Primary arrangement: circle of chairs (no table barrier) for storytelling, reflection, and deliberation phases. Circle diameter 3–4 m — large enough for 16 people, small enough for soft-voice conversation (personal-to-social proxemic distance).
- Secondary arrangement: long table for shared meals. The table should be narrow enough (70–80 cm) that people seated across from each other are within personal proxemic distance.
- Display walls for pattern cards, Memory Maps, Quality Star posters, Elder Quality Criteria, Memory Market Ledger — the accumulated artifacts of the program, visible and touchable.
- Good lighting (elder visual accessibility), comfortable temperature (elder thermal comfort), and acoustic management (elder auditory accessibility — reduce echo, eliminate background noise).
- The Steinfeuergrube (fire pit) as the ultimate sociopetal center: when available, the fire draws people into a circle, activates all sensory channels (warmth, light, smell of smoke, crackle of flame, flickering visual), and creates the most ancient form of human gathering space.

**Proxemic profile:** Personal (circle, shared meal) to Intimate (fire, storytelling, object passing). All channels active. This zone should feel like the heart of the campus — the place where everything converges.

# PART FIVE: The Facilitator's First Season — A Narrative Guide

## What to Expect, Month by Month

### March: Preparation

You have the documents. You have the campus. You have the equipment (or the shopping list to acquire it). Now you need to prepare the space and yourself.

**Week 1–2:** Walk every transect route you plan to use this year. Alone. Slowly. Do the Ring 0 body-calibration at the start of each walk. Take notes on transitions. Photograph every point where you would stop with a group. Measure walking times. Identify hazards. This is your embodied preparation — you cannot facilitate what you have not experienced.

Stock the Boden-Koffer. Print the first season's field sheets, worksheets, and cards. Prepare the QGIS project. Test all electronic equipment. Set up the soil observation stations in Zone B.

**Week 3–4:** Your first workshop — the adults/families soil encounter (A.2). This is deliberately your opening act: adults are the most forgiving audience, the most likely to give you useful feedback, and the most capable of articulating what works and what doesn't. Their feedback shapes your facilitation for the entire year.

### April–May: Spring Programming

The rhythm establishes itself. Children arrive with energy and fresh perception. Adults return for the token economy workshop. You learn what your campus can support: how many people fit at the soil stations, how long the garden loop takes, where the GIS projector works best.

The pattern cards begin to accumulate. The first token transactions are recorded. The QGIS project gets its first participant-contributed data layers.

**Pay attention to transitions.** The moment between soil observation and indoor mapping. The moment between individual reflection and group synthesis. The moment between the game and the debrief. These transitions are where engagement lives or dies — and they are all proxemic moments (moving from intimate to social distance, from sociofugal to sociopetal arrangement). Your Proxemic Audit will help you plan these; your experience will help you feel them.

### June–August: Summer Depth

The residency is your deepest engagement. Walking the first transect with the resident is one of the most rewarding experiences the program offers — a full day of sustained attention to landscape, shared with someone whose discipline reveals what you cannot see.

The children's bioregion mapping day (C.1) is logistically the most demanding workshop of the year: off-campus transects with multiple teams, GPS tracking, safety management, and a synthesis session that requires both analog and digital mapping. Run it in July when you have spring experience under your belt.

The Quality Star session (D.1) at the end of the summer children's program produces your first formal evaluation data. Take it seriously: photograph the Star, compile the Portfolio Sheets, write your facilitator reflection. This is the seed of your Quality Report.

### September–October: Cross-Border Season

The most logistically complex workshops of the year. Begin coordination with your Polish partner organization in July. Confirm bilingual facilitation, transport, and shared meal provisions by August.

The cross-border soil encounter (A.5) is the emotional center: the moment when participants from two countries kneel in the same soil and discover it is identical. The proxemic significance of this moment — shoulder-to-shoulder across a cultural boundary, mediated by the earth — is the deepest pedagogical mechanism you will deploy all year. Let it breathe. Don't rush.

The two-day bioregion mapping (C.5) is the most ambitious workshop of the year. It requires crossing the border, walking on both sides, and synthesizing data from two countries into a single map. If you can do this, you can do anything in the program.

### November–December: Elder Season

The tempo changes. Slower. Warmer. Quieter. The elder workshops require a different facilitation presence: less directive, more spacious, more patient. The Kaffee und Kuchen is not a break — it is the proxemic center of the elder experience. Invest in good cake.

The Memory Map (C.3) and the Wisdom Circle (D.3) produce irreplaceable data. Record everything (with consent). Transcribe promptly. These workshops cannot be repeated with the same participants — every elder's contribution is unique and time-limited.

### January–February: Synthesis and Planning

The year's data is spread across pattern cards, field sheets, maps, token records, portfolios, GPS tracks, audio recordings, and photographs. The Annual Data Synthesis brings it together.

Compile:
- All pattern cards into a preliminary pattern language (wall display in Zone E)
- All GPS tracks and transition data into the QGIS bioregion project
- All token transactions into the annual token ledger
- All Quality Star, Quality Compass, and Elder Quality Criteria into the Quality Report
- All photographs into the documentation archive

The Quality Report is your BNE certification evidence and your program improvement guide. It answers: What did we do? Who did we serve? What did they learn? What should change?

Then: plan Year 2. The calendar repeats, but with new cohorts, accumulated data, and the lessons of experience.

# PART SIX: Troubleshooting

## Common Challenges and Proxemic Solutions

**Challenge: Participants lose interest during the mapping synthesis (C.2, C.5).**
*Proxemic diagnosis:* They have moved from intimate/personal distance (the transect walk) to social/public distance (standing around a projected map) without transition. Three sensory channels closed at once.
*Solution:* Bring transect artifacts into the mapping room — soil samples from transition points, rocks from geological boundaries, plants from vegetation edges. Place them on the map at their geographic locations. Now the map has things to touch and smell, and the participants are back in personal proxemic relationship with the territory.

**Challenge: Teenagers are embarrassed by the soil protocol.**
*Proxemic diagnosis:* The soil protocol requires intimate proxemic behavior (kneeling, smelling, handling earth) in front of peers — a high-vulnerability zone for adolescents.
*Solution:* Frame it professionally ("this is how geologists work"). Pair participants so they share the vulnerability. Demonstrate first without commentary. Reduce the group observation moments (don't make anyone smell soil in front of 25 peers). The embarrassment usually dissolves within 10 minutes if the facilitator is matter-of-fact.

**Challenge: The elder Wisdom Circle is dominated by one or two voices.**
*Proxemic diagnosis:* Sociopetal space (the circle) invites participation but doesn't distribute it. Dominant voices fill the social proxemic field.
*Solution:* Use a talking object (a stone, a tool, an artifact) passed hand to hand. The object is a proxemic mediator: only the person holding it speaks. Its physical weight and warmth create an intimate proxemic relationship between the speaker and the circle's attention.

**Challenge: Cross-border participants cluster by nationality.**
*Proxemic diagnosis:* People default to their cultural proxemic norms, which align with language. German speakers stand with German speakers at familiar German proxemic distances; Polish speakers do the same.
*Solution:* Assign cross-national pairs from the start. Give each pair a shared physical task (dig soil together, walk a transect together, prepare food together). The shared task is the proxemic mediator that overrides the cultural default.

**Challenge: The GIS exploration feels disconnected from the rest of the day.**
*Proxemic diagnosis:* The GIS screen creates a sociofugal, public-distance, vision-only environment. It is the most proxemically impoverished phase of any workshop.
*Solution:* Never run GIS for more than 20 minutes without a proxemic intervention. Toggle a layer, then pass around a physical sample from that layer. Show a watershed boundary, then pour water on a tilted tray and watch it flow. The GIS is powerful for synthesis but lethal for engagement if it monopolizes the sensory field.
