# Soil Colour as Physics — Pedagogical Framework

## Earth Pigments from the Soils of Müllrose

**Erdpuls Müllrose — Living Laboratory & Makerspace Garden**

*Part of the "Brücken bauen durch Boden — 13 Questions to the Soil" project*

* * *

## Overview

This Framework document defines the pedagogical principles, learning progressions, cross-curricular connections, BNE quality alignment, and structural logic governing the three grade-band lesson plans (Classes 1–4, 5–8, and 9–12) for the Soil Colour as Physics unit. It is the architectural document that explains *why* the lesson plans are designed as they are.

* * *

## Guiding Principles

### 1. Body First, Then Instrument

All learning in this unit begins with direct sensory engagement before any measuring tool, vocabulary, or explanation is introduced. Students handle soil with their hands, observe colour with their eyes, and smell the difference between fen soil and sandy soil before they open a textbook. This principle is non-negotiable across all grade levels.

The instrument — whether that is a sieve, a spectrometer, or a CIELAB colour formula — is always introduced as a way to confirm and deepen what the hands already know, not as a replacement for direct experience.

This approach has a direct parallel in the work of Gerd Wessolek (Emeritus, TU Berlin), whose concept of *Soil Art* as a mediating practice argues that soil science needs sensory and artistic means to reach beyond the specialist community and become genuinely felt knowledge. His co-edited volume *Field to Palette* (Toland, Noller & Wessolek 2019) provides the most comprehensive documentation of this principle across disciplines. The Erdpuls WP4 exhibition (104 soil paintings) is an independent instantiation of exactly the same idea.

### 2. The 4A-Pathway

Every educational sequence at Erdpuls follows the 4A-Pathway. This unit is designed so that the four stages map onto the four experimental phases of the full sequence, but each individual lesson unit also contains a micro-version of the complete pathway.

| Stage | Description | Question it answers |
|---|---|---|
| **Awareness** | Direct sensory encounter with the phenomenon — before explanation | *"What do I notice?"* |
| **Acknowledgment** | Recognition that the impression can be measured and explained | *"Is this real? Can I verify it?"* |
| **Attitude** | Formation of a personal position through investigation | *"What do I think this means?"* |
| **Action** | The finding becomes material for something beyond the classroom | *"What do I do with this?"* |

### 3. Three-Stream Pedagogy

Each lesson engages all three streams simultaneously wherever possible:

| Stream | What it means in this unit |
|---|---|
| **Head** | Optics, mineralogy, colour physics, chemical concepts, data analysis |
| **Hands** | Grinding, sieving, painting, measuring, observing through instruments |
| **Heart** | The soil as a record of care; the pigment as the soil's voice in the exhibition; the act of making as a form of knowing |

### 4. Authentic Output

Students produce real pigments for a real exhibition (WP4, "104 Answers"). The pedagogical power of this cannot be replicated by a simulation. Every lesson should carry a strand of awareness that the work matters beyond the school.

### 5. Proxemic Progression

Drawing on Proxemics Theory (Hall, 1966), the unit deliberately moves students through different relational distances to the soil:

- **Intimate distance** (< 45 cm): Hands in the soil, face close to the sample, wet grinding on glass.
- **Personal distance** (45–120 cm): Observing samples on the lab bench, discussing with a partner.
- **Social distance** (1.2–3.6 m): Presenting findings to the class, comparing sample sets from different farms.
- **Public distance** (> 3.6 m): The exhibition — the pigment now at a distance from the student, entering the public world.

This spatial progression is not accidental. It mirrors the 4A-Pathway: intimate encounter (Awareness) → personal investigation (Acknowledgment) → social dialogue (Attitude) → public action (Action).

## Learning Progression Across Grade Bands

The unit is structured as a developmental spiral. Each grade band revisits the same phenomena — soil colour, wet-dry effects, grinding, binder behaviour — at a progressively more abstract and quantitative level.

| Dimension | Classes 1–4 | Classes 5–8 | Classes 9–12 |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Cognitive mode** | Sensory-phenomenological | Observational-experimental | Hypothetical-deductive |
| **Primary question** | "What colours are in the soil?" | "Why does the colour change?" | "What does the colour tell us?" |
| **Physics concepts** | Colour, light/dark, wet/dry | Light scattering, particle size, binder | Mie scattering, spectroscopy, CIELAB, ligand field theory |
| **Mathematics** | Colour sorting, counting | Graphing, sieve fractions as percentages | Regression, Δ*E* values, statistical correlation |
| **Primary method** | Discovery, play, making | Structured experiment, measurement | Independent research design |
| **Output** | Personal colour painting | Class pigment set + binder comparison chart | Correlation dataset + research report |
| **4A emphasis** | Awareness + Action | Acknowledgment + Action | Attitude + Action |
| **BNE Gestaltungskompetenz** | 4.1.1 (new perspectives), 4.1.3 (interdisciplinary) | 4.1.4 (risk recognition), 4.2.1 (collaborative planning) | 4.1.2 (forward-looking analysis), 4.3.1 (self-motivation) |

## Lesson Unit Structure

All lessons follow a consistent internal rhythm, regardless of grade level. This predictability helps students enter the work quickly and allows teachers to manage transitions cleanly.

### The 45-Minute Unit Template

| Phase | Duration | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| **Opening / Anchor** | 5 min | Connect to previous learning; pose the question for today |
| **Direct Experience** | 10–15 min | Hands-on engagement with the material — observation, handling, first impressions |
| **Investigation** | 15–20 min | Structured experiment, measurement, discussion, or model-building |
| **Synthesis** | 8–10 min | What did we notice? What does it mean? How does it connect? |
| **Closing / Forward** | 3–5 min | Journal entry, preview of next unit, contribution to the colour library |

## BNE Quality Framework Alignment (Brandenburg Catalogue)

This unit directly addresses the following criteria of the *Qualitätskatalog für außerschulische Anbieterinnen und Anbieter von BNE im Land Brandenburg* (MLUK, April 2023):

| Criterion | How it is met |
|---|---|
| 1.1.1 Lebenswelt-Bezug | Content is grounded in Müllrose soils, local farms, and the Naturpark Schlaubetal |
| 1.2.1 Target groups concretely described | Three grade bands with distinct objectives, methods, and cognitive demands |
| 2.1.1 Multidimensional | Ecological, economic, social, and cultural dimensions explicitly connected |
| 2.1.2 Interdisciplinary | Physics, chemistry, art, ecology, and agronomy integrated throughout |
| 2.2.1 Controversial thesis | The central project thesis (attitude → soil → colour) is a hypothesis, not a given fact |
| 3.1.1 Action-oriented | Students physically collect, grind, measure, and produce real pigments |
| 3.1.2 Experience-oriented | Fieldwork phase grounds all learning in direct sensory encounter |
| 3.1.3 Discovery-based | Sorting samples by colour "without explanation" (Grades 5–8) as explicit discovery methodology |
| 3.1.4 Cooperative | Partner farm sampling; group correlation study design |
| 3.1.5 Reflective | Wet–dry diagrams, binder comparison, spectroscopy all require explanation of observations |
| 3.2 Theoretical grounding | Full theoretical background in the concept document (Sections 3 and 9) |
| 4.1.1 New perspectives | Three farming systems compared; iron oxide pigments as shared global heritage |
| 4.1.4 Risk recognition | Silicosis safety protocol explicitly teaches precautionary behaviour |
| 4.3.1 Self-motivation | Each student's pigment production contributes to a real public exhibition |

## The Central Project Thesis as a Pedagogical Device

The project thesis — *"A farmer's inner attitude toward the soil is reflected in measurable soil quality"* — is unusual in school science because it is:

- **Not provable by any single experiment.** It remains a hypothesis.
- **Genuinely contested.** Reasonable scientists and farmers disagree.
- **Open to multiple disciplines.** Physics can measure colour; ecology can measure humus; philosophy can question what "inner attitude" means.

This is an intentional pedagogical choice. Students at all grade levels encounter the thesis at an appropriate level of complexity, and they are never told "the answer." The unit ends with the question more open, not more closed.

For Classes 1–4: the question is implicit — "why do different farms have different colours?"
For Classes 5–8: the question is introduced and discussed but not resolved.
For Classes 9–12: the question is the basis of an independent research investigation.

* * *

## Seasonal Integration

The unit is most powerful when conducted across the school year, allowing students to return to the same sites as conditions change:

| Season | Activity | What it reveals |
|---|---|---|
| February–March | Initial soil sampling | Winter colours, high moisture, baseline measurements |
| April–May | Lab processing, spectroscopy | Spring drying, colour shift as soils warm |
| May–June | Pigment production for WP4 | Correlation with sowing season |
| September | Deepening experiment | Post-summer colour comparison; drought effects on colour |

Even if your group can only complete one visit, try to photograph the sample sites in multiple seasons for comparison. The colour archive is itself a seasonal record.
