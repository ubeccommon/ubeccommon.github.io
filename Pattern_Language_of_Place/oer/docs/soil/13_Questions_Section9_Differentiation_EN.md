# Brücken bauen durch Boden – 13 Questions to the Soil
## An Anthroposophic Pedagogically Oriented Educational Project

* * *

# 9. Differentiation and Extensions
### Grade-Specific Adaptations for Grades 1–4, 5–8, and 9–12

* * *

> **Guiding Principle: Youth teaches technology – Age teaches tradition**
>
> Each grade level brings different qualities to the intergenerational tandem. The differentiated approaches are not parallel units running side by side, but interacting layers of the same living learning field.

This section describes how the core activities of the "Brücken bauen durch Boden" project — soil observation, sensor technology, dialogue, and artistic documentation — are adapted and extended for different developmental stages. The principles of anthroposophic pedagogy provide the framework: feeling-based experience in the lower school, discovery-based understanding in the middle school, and judgment-based action in the upper school.

* * *

## 9.1 Overview: Differentiation Matrix

The following matrix shows how the five project modules (Questionnaire Dialogues, Sensor Station Network, Intergenerational Tandems, Art & Documentation, Science) are shaped differently at each grade level:

| Dimension | Grades 1–4 · *"Feeling-Based Experience"* | Grades 5–8 · *"Discovery-Based Understanding"* | Grades 9–12 · *"Judgment-Based Action"* |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Mode of knowing** | Sensory-oriented: smelling, feeling, tasting soil | Experimental: measuring, comparing, documenting | Scientific: hypotheses, data analysis, publication |
| **Working method** | Open-ended play and observation | Structured projects with defined questions | Independent research initiatives |
| **Art** | Art as primary form of expression | Art as documentation and reflection | Art as critical commentary |
| **Tandem role** | Seniors as storytellers | Joint work at sensor stations | Seniors as subject-matter experts in dialogue |
| **Language** | Imaginative, picture-rich language | Subject-specific vocabulary, introductory statistics | Scientific language, meta-critique |

* * *

## 9.2 Grades 1–4: Feeling-Based Experience
**Lower School · Ages 6–10 · Anthroposophic Developmental Phase: Imitation and Authority**

### Pedagogical Orientation

In the first four grades, direct sensory encounter with the soil takes centre stage. Soil is not explained — it is experienced. Children make friends with the earth through touch, smell, sound, and sight. Every activity is embedded in rhythm, image, and gesture — the natural learning language of this developmental phase.

### 9.2.1 Differentiated Activities

**Questionnaire Dialogues (WP1)**
- No direct participation in the questionnaire dialogues with farmers
- Instead: developing their own "children's questions to the soil"
  - Grades 1–2: oral circle conversations with open-ended prompts from the teacher
  - Grades 3–4: first written responses in illustrated "soil diaries"
- Visit to one of the three partner farms as a sensory-oriented field trip
  - Barefoot walking on different soil types (humus, sand, clay)
  - Collecting soil samples and naming them by colour, smell, and texture

**Sensor Station Network (WP2)**
- The senseBox as a "magic eye": what can the machine see that we cannot?
- Children tend their sensor station ritually: a daily passing ritual, a greeting to the earth
- Reading display values in simple symbols and colours (not numbers)
  - Grey = the soil is sad/thirsty; Green = the soil is happy/well-fed
- Weekly record as a picture calendar: sun, clouds, rain, and a "soil face"
- Extension for Grade 4: reading first numbers at the station and entering them into a table

**Intergenerational Tandems (WP3)**
- Seniors in the role of "soil storytellers"
  - Memories of agriculture from earlier generations
  - What has changed? What has remained?
- Cooking together with vegetables from the school garden ("From the soil to the table")
- Garden work as a shared, action-oriented encounter
- Extension: "Soil memory game" — created by seniors using local earth pigments

**Art & Documentation (WP4)**
- Earth pigment painting: children paint their favourite soil type using local pigments
- Clay figures: shaping soil creatures from real earth (earthworm, beetle, fungal mycelium)
- Grades 1–2: collective soil painting as a class mural
- Grades 3–4: individual "soil soul" paintings shown at the final exhibition
- Soil song: setting a self-composed poem to the soil to music

**Scientific Cooperation**
- Dr. Monika Joschko visits the class as a "soil godmother" (hands-on station, not a lecture)
- Microscope station: examining soil samples under a smartphone microscope
- "What lives in the soil?" — identification cards with colourful illustrations

### 9.2.2 Extension Opportunities

> **Deepening for especially engaged classes:** Grade 3 is particularly well-suited for a dedicated farming epoch with a direct project connection: the children sow, tend, and harvest their own plot and document everything in their epoch notebook. This plot can be taken over the following year by the next Grade 3 cohort, creating an intergenerational cycle of care.

- Cooperation with the music class: "Soil symphony" as a rhythm performance on World Soil Day
- Bookbinding: a personal "little soil book" as an end-of-year gift for the family
- Parent evening: children present their soil discoveries and answer questions
- Connection to the farming epoch in Grade 3: experiencing soil as a living organism

## 9.3 Grades 5–8: Discovery-Based Understanding
**Middle School · Ages 11–14 · Anthroposophic Developmental Phase: Causality and Empathy**

### Pedagogical Orientation

The middle school years are the phase of inquiry and discovery. Causal connections come to the fore: why is this soil different from that one? What does humus actually do? Students learn to understand soil as a system — and to reflect on their own relationship to the soil. The connection of head (knowing), heart (feeling), and hands (doing) is especially important in this phase.

### 9.3.1 Differentiated Activities

**Questionnaire Dialogues (WP1) — Students as Facilitators**
- Grades 7–8: active participation in the questionnaire dialogues with farmers
- Preparation: analysing all 13 questions and developing their own perspective
- Role as neutral facilitators — no judgement, only documentation
  - Learning goal: distinguishing between facilitation and personal opinion
- Grades 5–6: preparation through role-play exercises in the classroom
  - Simulation of a questionnaire dialogue with multiple perspectives
- Reflection: which answers surprised me? Why?
- Extension Grade 8: propose and justify a new question for the next dialogue

**Sensor Station Network (WP2) — Reading and Interpreting Data**
- Independent, responsible management of a senseBox station on a weekly rotation
- Grades 5–6: reading, recording, comparing ("How does soil temperature change?")
- Grade 7: first statistical evaluations (mean, range of variation)
  - Hand-drawn diagrams — artistic design of the epoch notebook
- Grade 8: correlation analysis between weather data and soil moisture
  - First encounter with the concept of "correlation" and its limitations
- Extension: comparing sensor data from the three partner farms
  - Developing a hypothesis: do different farming methods show measurable differences?

**Intergenerational Tandems (WP3) — Shared Knowledge Work**
- Permanent tandem pairing for the full school year: student + senior
- Division of roles: student explains sensor operation; senior explains soil history
- Shared "soil protocol": technical data + personal memory
- Grades 5–6: structured counter-narratives ("When I was your age, the soil was…")
- Grades 7–8: thematic interview for the podcast production
  - Preparation, recording, and post-production as a school project

## 9.4 Grades 9–12: Judgment-Based Action
**Upper School · Ages 15–18 · Anthroposophic Developmental Phase: Abstraction and Independence**

### Pedagogical Orientation

The upper school works scientifically, socio-critically, and with conceptual artistry. Students formulate their own research questions, develop hypotheses, and take responsibility for their findings. The project in the upper school is not something to be "completed" — it is a living research field to which genuine contributions are made: for science, for the region, for society.

## 9.5 Cross-Grade Connections

Although each level has its own distinct approach, the connections between grade levels are an essential quality feature of the project. The following overview shows how projects and products circulate across age groups:

| Type of connection | Description | Grade levels involved |
|---|---|---|
| **Mentoring** | Upper school accompanies middle school in sensor maintenance and data analysis | Gr. 5–8 + Gr. 9–12 |
| **Tandem chain** | Intergenerational tandems link senior, student (middle), and younger child | Gr. 1–4 + Gr. 7–8 + Senior |
| **Artwork handover** | Lower school paintings are curated by middle school and exhibited by upper school | All levels |
| **Questionnaire relay** | Grade 4 develops children's questions; Gr. 8 adapts; Gr. 12 analyses | Gr. 4 -> Gr. 8 -> Gr. 12 |
| **Podcast** | Upper school produces; middle school interviews lower school and seniors | Gr. 5–6 + Gr. 11–12 |
| **Annual report** | Each level contributes a chapter; produced as a shared document | All levels |

* * *

## 9.6 Inclusion and Special Support

The curriculum of "Brücken bauen durch Boden" is designed to be open to diverse learning needs. The variety of entry points — artistic, technical, scientific, social — ensures that every student can make a meaningful contribution.

**Differentiation strategies**
- Offer choice: every level provides at least three different entry points
- Vary products: painting, writing, measuring, conversation, and performance are of equal value
- Scale complexity: offer the same activity at three levels of difficulty
- Peer teaching: more advanced students explain to beginners — both learn in the process
- External support: tandems with seniors as a natural differentiation resource

**Special learning needs**
- High-ability learners: developing their own research questions, competition entries, academic publication
- Writing difficulties: prioritise artistic and practical entry points
- Concentration challenges: short, rhythmically alternating tasks at the sensor station
- Hearing impairment: visual representation of sensor data instead of acoustic signals
- Motor impairments: tablet-based documentation instead of fieldwork

* * *

## 9.7 Assessment and Feedback

In keeping with anthroposophic pedagogy, the project does not use grades as the primary assessment instrument. Instead, we work with qualitative feedback, portfolio approaches, and peer-based feedback.

| Form of assessment | Grades 1–4 | Grades 5–8 | Grades 9–12 |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Teacher** | Oral appreciation | Epoch notebook feedback | Scientific peer-review feedback |
| **Presentation** | Show and tell in front of the class | Portfolio with self-assessment | Symposium presentation with expert feedback |
| **Tandem** | Senior gives personal feedback | Tandem review conversation | Self-evaluation and methodological critique |
| **Exhibition** | Participation as recognition | Curatorship as evidence of competence | Curatorial responsibility as leadership experience |
