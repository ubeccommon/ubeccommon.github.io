### Phase 3 Translation Status

All OER guides (01–05) require DE and PL translations before full trilingual OER publication. Recommended Phase 3 sequence:

1. `04_teachers_guide.md` → DE (highest priority: the primary audience for German OER platforms is teachers)
2. `01_learning_guide_grades_1-4.md` → DE then PL (most frequently used workshop audience)
3. `05_citizen_scientist_handbook.md` → DE then PL (large potential audience on German-language OER platforms)
4. `02_learning_guide_grades_5-8.md` → DE then PL
5. `03_learning_guide_grades_9-12.md` → DE then PL

## Reading Paths

### "I have one hour. What should I read?"
→ Pattern Discovery Toolkit, Parts 1–2 (Foundations + Method). This gives you the concentric ring structure, the phenomenological observation method, proxemics as spatial grammar, and the basic workshop flow.

### "I need to run a workshop next week."
→ The specific Living Experience Guide for your target group and appendix. Then the corresponding Proxemic Supplement (in the Proxemic Integration document). Then the Universal Checklist in the Implementation Handbook.

### "I'm preparing the annual program."
→ Implementation Handbook (full). Then the Pattern Language Assembly Guide (to understand what the year is building toward).

### "I want to understand the theoretical framework."
→ Pattern Discovery Toolkit (full, including Part 5: Theoretical Roots). Then the Proxemic Integration (Part One: Revised Theoretical Foundations). Then the BNE-Bewertung for the quality framework alignment.

### "I need to write a funding proposal or certification application."
→ BNE-Bewertung und Leitbild (the institutional compliance document). Supplemented by the Pattern Language Assembly Guide (which shows what the program produces) and the Implementation Handbook (which shows how it operates).

### "I want to adapt this for my own initiative."
→ Pattern Discovery Toolkit, Part 4 (Adaptation Guide). Then the Appendices D.4 (Adapting to Other Quality Frameworks). Then select the Living Experience Guides most relevant to your target groups, understanding that every place will discover different patterns using the same method.

### "I am a classroom teacher preparing to bring my class."
→ `04_teachers_guide.md` first (your complete briefing document). Then the relevant student learning guide for your grade band (01, 02, or 03). The Implementation Handbook provides operational detail if needed.

### "I want to become a citizen scientist."
→ `05_citizen_scientist_handbook.md`. Then attend an Erdpuls Open Makerspace Day to build a senseBox station and start contributing to the openSenseMap network.

## The Five Target Groups Across All Documents

Every living experience guide is differentiated for the same five groups. This table shows where each group appears:

| Target Group | Appendix A Guide | Appendix B Guide | Appendix C Guide | Appendix D Guide |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Children/Youth** (8–18) | Erdreich-Entdecker | Das Garten-Wirtschaftsspiel | Wo hört unser Ort auf? | Habe ich etwas Echtes gelernt? |
| **Adults/Families** | Boden-Begegnung | Sehen, was wir schon tauschen | Die Karte unter der Karte | Was macht es wert, wiederzukommen? |
| **Elders/Intergenerational** | Boden-Gedächtnis | Der Erinnerungsmarkt | Die Landschaft erinnert sich | Was ist es wert, weitergegeben zu werden? |
| **Artists/Researchers** | Boden-Tiefe | Wert jenseits des Preises | Kartografien der Zugehörigkeit | Messen, was zählt |
| **Cross-Border DE/PL** | Boden-Brücke | Eine Wirtschaft, Zwei Sprachen | Eine Landschaft, Zwei Länder | Qualität ohne Grenzen |

*Note: The OER Layer (Layer 6) differentiates by school grade band rather than by Erdpuls target group. Guide 01 (Grades 1–4) corresponds to the younger range of the Children/Youth group. Guides 02–03 (Grades 5–12) correspond to the older range. The Teachers' Guide and Citizen Scientist Handbook serve audiences not covered by the 20 Living Experience Guides.*

* * *

## The Five OER Competency Clusters

All OER Layer documents are aligned to five competency clusters, which correspond to the Brandenburg BNE Gestaltungskompetenzen:

| Cluster | BNE Alignment | Appears Most Strongly In |
|---|---|---|
| **Environmental Literacy** | 4.1.1, 4.1.2, 4.1.3 | All three student guides; Ch. 2 of Citizen Scientist Handbook |
| **Scientific Inquiry** | 4.1.4, 4.2.1, 4.3.2 | Guide 02 (full protocol); Guide 03 (research track); Ch. 2–3 of Handbook |
| **Technology Competence** | 4.1.2, 4.3.2 | Guide 02–03 (senseBox); Ch. 6 of Handbook (station building) |
| **Economic Understanding** | 4.2.2, 4.2.3, 4.3.1 | Guide 02 (four elements); Guide 03 (UBECrc design); Ch. 4 of Handbook |
| **Social-Emotional Learning** | 4.2.4, 4.3.3, 4.3.4 | Guide 01 (Token Seeds, closing circle); Guide 02 (4A-Pathway); Ch. 5 of Handbook |

* * *

## SDG Alignment

The Erdpuls program addresses eight confirmed SDGs (Tiers 1–2) and two additional SDGs pending author confirmation (Tier 3). The full evidence table with specific document citations is maintained in `00_METADATA_PACKAGE.md` (Section 1.4). The summary below is for quick reference and cross-referencing.

| SDG | Title | Tier | Primary OER Layer Expression |
|---|---|---|---|
| **SDG 3** | Good Health and Well-Being | 2 — Secondary | PM2.5/PM10/CO₂/UV monitoring (Guide 05 Ch.3, Ch.6); WHO air quality thresholds explicitly cited |
| **SDG 4** | Quality Education | 1 — Primary | Core purpose of all five guides; 12/12 Gestaltungskompetenzen; 86% of 69 BNE criteria; full curriculum alignment |
| **SDG 6** | Clean Water and Sanitation | 2 — Secondary | Water infiltration test connecting to groundwater recharge, flood risk (All student guides Q8; Appendix A) |
| **SDG 10** | Reduced Inequalities | 2 — Secondary | Collective Threshold Model (4 participation pathways); multilingual OER; cross-border DE/PL access |
| **SDG 11** | Sustainable Cities and Communities | 2 — Secondary | Bioregional mapping; commons-based token economy; community pattern language; heritage campus |
| **SDG 13** | Climate Action | 1 — Primary | Continuous sensor monitoring; phenology tracking; longitudinal soil records; openSenseMap contribution |
| **SDG 15** | Life on Land | 1 — Primary | 13-question soil protocol; Life Count biodiversity monitoring; iNaturalist/GBIF contribution; Schlaubetal reference site |
| **SDG 17** | Partnerships for the Goals | 1 — Primary | CC BY-SA 4.0 OER; open data (openSenseMap, GBIF); cross-border DE/PL program; open-source toolchain |
| **SDG 8** | Decent Work and Economic Growth | 3 — Tertiary* | Non-monetary labour recognition via token economy (primarily in supporting documents; see metadata package) |
| **SDG 9** | Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure | 3 — Tertiary* | Open-source senseBox IoT; Makerspace; citizen-built monitoring infrastructure (primarily a tool dimension) |

*Tier 3 SDGs are documented in the supporting document layer. Author should confirm whether to cite these in OER Layer platform submissions.

**Confirmed for platform submissions:** SDG 3, 4, 6, 10, 11, 13, 15, 17
