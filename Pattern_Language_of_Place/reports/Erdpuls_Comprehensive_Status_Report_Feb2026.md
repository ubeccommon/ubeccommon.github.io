## 2. Mission Statement (Leitbild) — Verbatim Vision and Summary

### Vision (from BNE-Leitbild, February 2026)

> *Erdpuls Müllrose ist ein Ort, an dem Menschen wieder lernen,*
> *wie eine Pflanze zu denken:*
> *verwurzelt im Ort, großzügig im Teilen, geduldig im Wachsen.*
> **Ein Ort, um wieder Mensch zu werden.**

### What the Vision Means

The Leitbild positions Erdpuls as a place where technology and nature are not opposites but complementary expressions of the same creative forces. On a campus of historic brick and living soil, the acts of observing, making, growing, and repairing converge as inseparable aspects of a single engagement with the living world.

The overarching documented goal is to **close the values-action gap** — the chasm between the value people assign to sustainability and the action they actually derive from it. The method is not instruction but *experience*: touching soil, building sensors, repairing objects, celebrating seasonal rhythms together.

### The Five Guiding Principles (Leitsätze)

1. **Sustainability in All Dimensions** — ecological, economic, social, and cultural, understood as an inseparable whole.
2. **Identity and Values** — the Plant Wisdom Framework (seven plant principles as a mirror of human values) and the Ubuntu philosophy (*"I am because we are"*) as ethical compass.
3. **Internal Culture** — participatory development through the Collective Threshold Model and Token Holder involvement; Incubator Village Beeskow as development framework.
4. **Service Profile** — BNE non-formal education, Citizen Science, Repair Café, Makerspace, Heritage Renovation, Artist-in-Residence programme, seasonal community celebrations.
5. **Target Groups and Partners** — five target groups; national and international partner networks (see §11).

* * *

## 3. The Six Pedagogical Models — Concise Explanation

Erdpuls combines six distinct theoretical and methodological models into a unified pedagogical architecture. None is used in isolation; each is explicitly interwoven with the others across all 20 Living Experience Guides.

### 3.1 Three-Stream Pedagogy (Head / Hands / Heart)

The foundational pedagogical principle. Every workshop engages all three streams simultaneously: **Head** (conceptual understanding, data interpretation, pattern recognition), **Hands** (making, measuring, repairing, building, growing), and **Heart** (felt experience, values reflection, empathy, aesthetic attention). The principle *"body first, then instrument"* operationalises this — participants encounter phenomena with their senses before any measuring device is introduced. This is simultaneously a Waldorf-derived pedagogical approach and a Goethean scientific commitment.

### 3.2 The 4A-Pathway (Awareness — Acknowledgment — Attitude — Action)

A four-stage structured progression that every educational sequence follows:

| Step | Name | Function |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Awareness** | Direct sensory encounter with the phenomenon (soil, economy, bioregion) |
| 2 | **Acknowledgment** | Recognition that it matters — personally, locally, globally |
| 3 | **Attitude** | Values reflection: what does this mean for how I want to live? |
| 4 | **Action** | Concrete, documented output: repair, plant, contribute data, design |

The 4A-Pathway is the spine of all 20 Living Experience Guides and maps directly to the BNE design competency framework (Transfer 21, all 12 sub-competencies). In the OER Layer, it is further calibrated to Anthroposophical developmental theory: Guide 01 (Grades 1–4) targets will-forces through embodied discovery; Guide 02 (Grades 5–8) engages causal reasoning; Guide 03 (Grades 9–12) engages individual ethical judgment.

### 3.3 Christopher Alexander's Pattern Language

Derived from Alexander's *A Pattern Language* (1977). The method holds that every healthy place has recurring, interconnected design patterns that emerge from close observation. Applied at Erdpuls as:

- A **concentric ring observation method**: Ring 0 (body calibration) — Ring 1 (intimate contact, 0–45 cm) — Ring 2 (middle ground, 45 cm–1.2 m) — Ring 3 (horizon, 1.2–3.6 m) — Ring 4 (bioregional boundary, 3.6 m+)
- **Pattern cards** as the tangible workshop output — documented, named, translated across three languages, and accumulated over time
- An **annual Pattern Language Assembly** ritual (January) that synthesises a year's workshop outputs into a coherent, place-specific pattern language

The Pattern Discovery Toolkit, its four appendices, and the Pattern Language Assembly Guide constitute the theoretical and operational documentation for this model.

### 3.4 Goethean Observation (Phänomenologische Methode)

Drawn from Goethe's scientific method (*Anschauende Urteilskraft*). Participants are guided to observe phenomena without premature categorisation — to hold what they see, hear, smell, touch, and intuit as primary data before reaching for measurement instruments or classification systems. This grounds the "body first" principle both scientifically and philosophically, and supports BNE criterion 4.3.1 (reflecting one's own values and assumptions). In the Soil Laboratory, it is operationalised as the **Sensor Dialogue**: every measurement exists as a pair — *Mein Wert* (estimated through senses) and *Sensor-Wert* (instrument reading) — not as a contest but as a structured encounter between two ways of knowing.

### 3.5 Proxemics Theory (Edward T. Hall)

Based on Hall's *The Hidden Dimension* (1966). Proxemics studies how spatial distance between people shapes the quality and depth of interaction. Applied at Erdpuls as a **spatial grammar for all workshop design**:

| Distance | Type | Application |
|---|---|---|
| 0–45 cm | Intimate | Soil contact, sensor handling, individual plant observation |
| 45–120 cm | Personal | Pair work, object passing, repair activities |
| 1.2–3.6 m | Social | Small group pattern discussion, facilitation |
| 3.6 m+ | Public | Presentations, campus orientation |

Every campus zone has a defined proxemic profile. The **Proxemic Audit** tool allows facilitators to evaluate and optimise spatial arrangements per learning objective. This model received major integration in February 2026 via the dedicated *Proxemic Integration* document (~9,650 words), which added a new Section 1.5 to the Pattern Discovery Toolkit (~910 words), proxemic supplements for all 20 Living Experience Guides, and a standalone Proxemic Facilitator's Guide.

**Key documented insight:** the loss when everything becomes a transaction is not merely sentimental — it is a loss of information carried by proximity that only flows at personal distance. The token economy is designed to restore and reward proxemic closeness.

### 3.6 The Four-Element Token Economy (Web4 / Stellar Blockchain)

A reciprocal economy implemented on the Stellar blockchain that maps value flows to four ecological and ethical principles:

| Token | Principle | Recognised When... |
|---|---|---|
| **Cooperation (Green)** | Working together | Participants co-facilitate, jointly name patterns, share tools |
| **Reciprocity (Blue)** | Bidirectional value flow | A participant both contributes and receives knowledge or care |
| **Mutualism (Orange)** | Benefit extends beyond participants | Citizen science data uploaded, OER materials created |
| **Regeneration (Gold)** | Demonstrable improvement | A hedgerow planted, a soil patch restored, an intergenerational event organised |

The **Collective Threshold Model** governs access to all workshops through four participation pathways: Full Rate, Supported Rate, Skills Exchange, and Token Pathway. The model ensures that those with the deepest knowledge of place can always participate regardless of financial means. Implemented on Stellar blockchain as part of the Web4 IoT+blockchain integration. Architecture is designed; implementation is scheduled for Phase 1.

## 4. Campus Architecture — Five Zones

| Zone | Name / Function | Proxemic Character |
|---|---|---|
| **A** | Precious Plastic \& Repair Workshop | Personal-to-intimate; hands-on fabrication |
| **B** | Garden \& Outdoor Soil Laboratory | Intimate-to-personal; sensory contact with soil and plants |
| **C** | Digital Lab (IoT, Arduino, senseBox) | Personal; technical construction and data work |
| **D** | Documentation \& Fabrication (3D print, laser, design) | Personal-to-social; design and review |
| **E** | Heritage \& Community Hub (Erzählcafé, Wisdom Circle, Community Kitchen) | Personal-to-intimate; storytelling, shared meals, fire circle |

Heritage renovation is an explicit educational content area, integrating traditional bricklaying and restoration craft with sustainability values.

* * *

## 5. Five Target Groups

All 20 Living Experience Guides are differentiated across the same five target groups:

1. **Children \& Youth** — school groups, informal learners, grades 5–7 primary focus
2. **Adults \& Families** — mixed-age community participants
3. **Elders \& Intergenerational Groups** — Wisdom Circles, knowledge transfer, Memory Market
4. **Artists \& Researchers** — Artist-in-Residence programme, Citizen Science extended projects
5. **Cross-Border German-Polish Groups** — DE/PL/EN trilingual programming, Oder-Neisse border region

* * *

## 6. Document Ecosystem — Complete Inventory

### Layer 7: Authoring Standards (`standards/` folder)

Two documents that govern how all Erdpuls markdown files are written and how Claude is instructed to create or update them. Maintained in a dedicated `standards/` folder in the repository, separate from the OER document collection. Both are indexed in project knowledge and available to Claude in every session without manual upload or pasting.

| File | Version | Purpose | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ERDPULS_MARKDOWN_STANDARD_v1_1.md` | 1.1 — February 2026 | Full authoring standard: YAML front matter, section dividers, heading depth, table syntax, special characters, emoji substitutions, file naming, Quarto/pandoc conversion rules, `column-widths.lua` filter documentation | (done) Active |
| `ERDPULS_CLAUDE_PROMPT_v1_1.md` | 1.1 — February 2026 | Summary prompt block for Claude sessions; common request templates (create, update, translate, fix for Quarto); version history | (done) Active |

**Key rules from the Standard (v1.1) now applied to all Erdpuls documents:**

- YAML front matter required on every file
- `* * *` for section dividers — never `---` in the body
- Maximum heading depth `####`; never `#####` or `######`
- No `|` in heading lines or YAML values
- `\&` inside all table cells
- Plain `-` separators in all tables
- No emoji — text equivalents: `(done)`, `(pending)`, `(not started)`, `[DE]`, `[PL]`
- Platform capitalisation: openSenseMap, iNaturalist, senseBox, UBECrc, QGIS, BNE
- Token element colours: Cooperation (Green), Reciprocity (Blue), Mutualism (Orange), Regeneration (Gold)
- `column-widths.lua` handles landscape orientation and column widths automatically — no manual hints needed in source files

* * *

## 8. Soil Laboratory — Boden-Labor

### Design Principles

The laboratory is built on four documented design principles:

1. **The Sensor Dialogue** — every measurement exists as a pair: *Mein Wert* (human sense estimate) and *Sensor-Wert* (instrument reading), operationalising Goethean science.
2. **Scalable Complexity** — the same laboratory serves a 10-year-old with crayons and a Munsell chart, and a researcher deploying long-term IoT sensors.
3. **Circularity and Repairability** — equipment is open-source, locally sourceable, or buildable in Zones A–D; single-use consumables minimised.
4. **Trilingual Labelling** — all equipment labels, reference cards, and instruction sheets are in DE/EN/PL.

### Three-Tier Equipment Architecture

| Tier | Name | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Tier 1** | KERN-AUSSTATTUNG (Core Kit) | Human senses as primary instruments; basic field tools used in every workshop |
| **Tier 2** | VERTIEFUNG (Extension Kit) | Simple analogue tools; reference materials for adult, elder, artist/researcher, and advanced youth groups |
| **Tier 3** | DIGITAL \& LANGZEIT | senseBox:edu IoT kits, Raspberry Pi dashboards, LoRaWAN, permanent sensor installations |

### Procurement Budget (from Einkaufsliste XLSX, February 2026 — 77 line items)

| Phase | Scope | Budget |
|---|---|---|
| Phase 1 | Core field equipment (immediate) | €525.50 |
| Phase 2 | Reference materials + extended measurement | €660.00 |
