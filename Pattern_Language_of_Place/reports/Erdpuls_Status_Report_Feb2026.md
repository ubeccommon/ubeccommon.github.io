## 2. Mission Statement (Leitbild) — Summary

### Vision (verbatim from the BNE-Leitbild, February 2026)

> *Erdpuls Müllrose ist ein Ort, an dem Menschen wieder lernen,*  
> *wie eine Pflanze zu denken:*  
> *verwurzelt im Ort, großzügig im Teilen, geduldig im Wachsen.*  
> **Ein Ort, um wieder Mensch zu werden.**

### What the Vision Means

The Leitbild positions Erdpuls as a place where technology and nature are not opposites but complementary expressions of the same creative forces. On a campus of historic brick and living soil, the acts of observing, making, growing, and repairing converge as inseparable aspects of a single engagement with the living world.

The overarching goal is to **close the values-action gap**: the documented chasm between the value people assign to sustainability and the action they actually derive from it. The method is not instruction but *experience* — touching soil, building sensors, repairing objects, celebrating seasonal rhythms together.

### The Five Guiding Principles (Leitsätze)

1. **Sustainability in All Dimensions** — ecological, economic, social, and cultural, understood as an inseparable whole.
2. **Identity and Values** — the Plant Wisdom Framework (seven plant principles as a mirror of human values) is the graphical Leitbild, alongside the Ubuntu philosophy ("I am because we are") as ethical compass.
3. **Internal Culture** — participatory development through the Collective Threshold Model and Token Holder involvement; Incubator Village Beeskow as development framework.
4. **Service Profile** — BNE non-formal education, Citizen Science, Repair Café, Makerspace, Heritage Renovation, Artist-in-Residence programme, seasonal community celebrations.
5. **Target Groups and Partners** — five target groups (see §5); national partners including Precious Plastic Deutschland, senseBox/Reedu, BNE-Akteur*innen; international partners including VULCA European Makerspace Network, Polish makerspace and conservation partners, Repair Café International, Stellar Development Foundation.

## 3. The Approach and Its Models

Erdpuls combines six distinct theoretical and methodological models into a unified pedagogical architecture. None is used in isolation; each is interwoven with the others.

### 3.1 Three-Stream Pedagogy (Head / Hands / Heart)

The foundational pedagogical principle. Every workshop and activity is designed to engage all three streams simultaneously:
- **Head** — conceptual understanding, data interpretation, pattern recognition
- **Hands** — direct making, measuring, repairing, building, growing
- **Heart** — felt experience, values reflection, empathy, aesthetic attention

The principle "body first, then instrument" operationalises this: participants encounter phenomena with their senses before any measuring device is introduced.

### 3.2 The 4A-Pathway

A structured progression that every educational sequence follows:

| Step | Name | Description |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Awareness** | Direct sensory encounter with the phenomenon (soil, economy, bioregion) |
| 2 | **Acknowledgment** | Recognition that it matters — personally, locally, globally |
| 3 | **Attitude** | Values reflection: what does this mean for how I want to live? |
| 4 | **Action** | Concrete, documented action: repair, plant, contribute data, design |

This pathway is the spine of all 20 Living Experience Guides and maps directly to the BNE design competency framework (Transfer 21, 12 sub-competencies).

### 3.3 Christopher Alexander's Pattern Language

Derived from Alexander's *A Pattern Language* (1977). The method holds that every healthy place has recurring, interconnected design patterns that emerge from close observation. Erdpuls applies this as:
- A **concentric ring observation method** (Ring 0 = body calibration → Ring 1 = intimate contact → Ring 2 = middle ground → Ring 3 = horizon → Ring 4 = bioregional boundary)
- **Pattern cards** as the tangible output of each workshop session — documented, named, translated, and assembled over time
- An **annual Pattern Language Assembly** ritual each January that synthesises a year's workshop outputs into a coherent, place-specific pattern language

### 3.4 Goethean Observation (Phänomenologische Methode)

Drawn from Goethe's scientific method (*Anschauende Urteilskraft*). Participants are guided to observe phenomena without premature categorisation — to hold what they see, hear, smell, touch, and intuit as primary data before reaching for measurement instruments or classification systems. This method grounds the "body first" principle scientifically and philosophically, and supports the self-competency dimension of BNE (Criterion 4.3.1: reflecting one's own values and assumptions).

### 3.5 Proxemics Theory (Edward T. Hall)

Based on Hall's *The Hidden Dimension* (1966). Proxemics studies how spatial distance between people shapes the quality and depth of interaction. Erdpuls applies this as a spatial grammar for all workshop design:

| Distance | Type | Application at Erdpuls |
|---|---|---|
| 0–45 cm | Intimate | Soil contact, sensor handling, individual plant observation |
| 45–120 cm | Personal | Pair work, object passing, repair activities |
| 1.2–3.6 m | Social | Small group pattern discussion, workshop facilitation |
| 3.6 m+ | Public | Presentations, large group overview, campus orientation |

Every campus zone has a defined proxemic profile. The Proxemic Audit tool allows facilitators to evaluate and optimise spatial arrangements for each learning objective. The Proxemic Integration document provides supplements for all 20 Living Experience Guides and a standalone Proxemic Facilitator's Guide.

**Key insight applied at Erdpuls:** the loss when everything becomes a transaction is not merely sentimental — it is a loss of information carried by proximity that only flows at personal distance. The token economy is designed to restore and reward proxemic closeness.

### 3.6 The Four-Element Token Economy (Web4 / Stellar Blockchain)

A reciprocal economy built on the Stellar blockchain that maps value flows to four ecological and ethical principles:

| Token | Principle | Recognised when... |
|---|---|---|
| **Cooperation** | Working together | Participants co-facilitate, jointly name patterns, share tools |
| **Reciprocity** | Bidirectional value flow | A participant both contributes and receives knowledge or care |
| **Mutualism** | Benefit extends beyond participants | Citizen science data uploaded, OER materials created, translations provided |
| **Regeneration** | Demonstrable improvement | A hedgerow planted, a soil patch restored, an intergenerational event organised |

The **Collective Threshold Model** governs economic access to all workshops through four participation pathways (Full Rate, Supported Rate, Skills Exchange, Token Pathway), ensuring that those with the deepest knowledge of place can always participate regardless of financial means. The model is implemented on Stellar blockchain and described as "Web4" — integrating IoT sensor networks with distributed ledger technology.

## 4. Campus Architecture — Five Zones

The 5,000 m² campus is structured into five pedagogical zones, each with a defined proxemic and learning character:

| Zone | Name / Function | Proxemic Character |
|---|---|---|
| **A** | Precious Plastic & Repair Workshop | Personal-to-intimate; hands-on fabrication |
| **B** | Garden & Outdoor Soil Laboratory | Intimate-to-personal; sensory contact with soil and plants |
| **C** | Digital Lab (IoT, Arduino, senseBox) | Personal; technical construction and data work |
| **D** | Documentation & Fabrication (3D print, laser, design) | Personal-to-social; design and review |
| **E** | Heritage & Community Hub (Erzählcafé, Wisdom Circle, Community Kitchen) | Personal-to-intimate; storytelling, shared meals, fire circle |

The campus buildings are of considerable architectural heritage significance. Heritage renovation itself is an explicit educational content area, integrating traditional bricklaying and restoration craft with sustainability values.

## 5. Five Target Groups

All 20 Living Experience Guides are differentiated across the same five target groups:

1. **Children & Youth** (school groups, informal learners, grades 5–7 primary focus)
2. **Adults & Families** (mixed-age community participants)
3. **Elders & Intergenerational Groups** (Wisdom Circles, knowledge transfer, Memory Market)
4. **Artists & Researchers** (Artist-in-Residence programme, Citizen Science extended projects)
5. **Cross-Border German-Polish Groups** (DE/PL/EN trilingual, Oder-Neisse border region programming)
