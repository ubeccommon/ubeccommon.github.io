## 2. Mission Statement (Leitbild)

### Vision (verbatim from BNE-Leitbild, February 2026)

> *Erdpuls Müllrose ist ein Ort, an dem Menschen wieder lernen,*
> *wie eine Pflanze zu denken:*
> *verwurzelt im Ort, großzügig im Teilen, geduldig im Wachsen.*
> **Ein Ort, um wieder Mensch zu werden.**

### What the Vision Means

The Leitbild positions Erdpuls as a place where technology and nature are not opposites but complementary expressions of the same creative forces. On a campus of historic brick and living soil, the acts of observing, making, growing, and repairing converge as inseparable aspects of a single engagement with the living world. The overarching documented goal is to **close the values-action gap** — the chasm between the value people assign to sustainability and the action they actually derive from it. The method is not instruction but experience: touching soil, building sensors, repairing objects, celebrating seasonal rhythms together.

### The Five Guiding Principles (Leitsätze)

The five Leitsätze establish the ethical and operational architecture of the project:

**Sustainability in All Dimensions** holds that ecological, economic, social, and cultural dimensions of sustainability are understood as an inseparable whole, never addressed in isolation. **Identity and Values** are anchored in two complementary frameworks: the Plant Wisdom Framework, in which seven plant principles serve as a mirror of human values, and the Ubuntu philosophy ("I am because we are") as the ethical compass for all community interactions. **Internal Culture** is developed through participatory governance — the Collective Threshold Model and Token Holder involvement — with the Incubator Village Beeskow as the legal and developmental framework. **Service Profile** encompasses BNE non-formal education, Citizen Science, Repair Café, Makerspace, Heritage Renovation, an Artist-in-Residence programme, and seasonal community celebrations. **Target Groups and Partners** are documented as five distinct audience groups with national and international partner networks (see Sections 5 and 11).

## 3. Core Definitions: Sustainability Literacy, Citizen Science, and Reciprocal Economics

These three concepts form the thematic triad that names the institution and gives the entire programme its intellectual architecture. They are not parallel or interchangeable; each addresses a different dimension of the values-action gap, and they are designed to reinforce each other through the campus's daily operations.

### 3.1 Sustainability Literacy

Sustainability Literacy is the capacity to understand, evaluate, and act upon the interconnected ecological, economic, social, and cultural dimensions of sustainability in one's own context. It is explicitly not a knowledge deficit to be filled by information transfer. Research consistently shows — and Erdpuls's programme design reflects — that the majority of people in Europe already *know about* climate change, biodiversity loss, and soil degradation in the abstract. What is missing is **embodied, sensory familiarity** with the living systems near them: the specific stream that runs behind the school, the specific soil profile that underlies the town, the specific seasonal rhythms that once structured local life.

Sustainability literacy at Erdpuls is therefore understood as a **competence of attention** before it becomes a competence of action. It is built through direct encounter with the sub-bioregion of the Naturpark Schlaubetal — not through PowerPoint presentations about planetary boundaries. The programme aligns with UNESCO's Education for Sustainable Development (ESD for 2030) framework and is formally assessed against the Brandenburg BNE Quality Catalog, which operationalises sustainability literacy through 12 Gestaltungskompetenzen (design competencies) derived from the Transfer 21 framework. All 12 competencies are addressed in the Erdpuls programme.

In German educational discourse, Sustainability Literacy corresponds to **Bildung für nachhaltige Entwicklung (BNE)**, understood as the capacity to "shape the future" (*Zukunft gestalten*) rather than merely adapt to it.

### 3.2 Citizen Science

Citizen Science is the practice of public participation in scientific inquiry — where non-professional participants contribute to systematic data collection, observation, and analysis alongside or independently of professional researchers. At Erdpuls, Citizen Science serves a double educational function: it is simultaneously a **methodology for learning** (participants learn by doing real science) and a **contribution to shared knowledge** (the data participants generate enters open, publicly accessible datasets).

The Erdpuls Citizen Science programme connects local observation directly to two major open platforms. Environmental and atmospheric data are contributed to **openSenseMap** (operated by the senseBox project, University of Münster), where they become part of a publicly queryable, globally distributed dataset. Biodiversity observations — plant species, soil organisms, birds, insects — are contributed to **iNaturalist**, where they are verified by the global research community and incorporated into open biodiversity databases used by conservation scientists worldwide. Over time, the accumulated dataset builds a longitudinal ecological record of the Naturpark Schlaubetal sub-bioregion that no professional research institution operating in the area currently maintains.

The Citizen Scientist Handbook (OER Guide 05) and the sensor dialogue methodology — in which every digital measurement is paired with a prior sensory estimate — ensure that Citizen Science at Erdpuls is genuinely educational rather than merely data-extractive. Participants understand *why* the data matters and *how* it is used, making them active co-investigators rather than passive data collectors.

### 3.3 Reciprocal Economics

Reciprocal Economics is an economic model in which value is defined not by market price alone but by ecological and social contribution — and in which exchange is structured to ensure that value flows in multiple directions rather than accumulating at a single point. The concept directly counters the extractive logic of conventional market economics, in which contributions that are difficult to price (ecological restoration, intergenerational knowledge transfer, voluntary community work, cross-cultural relationship-building) become invisible and therefore unsupported.

At Erdpuls, Reciprocal Economics is not theoretical: it is implemented as a functioning **Four-Element Token Economy**, in which every workshop, data contribution, repair, and act of community participation can generate tokens in four denominations that correspond to four ecological and ethical principles. These are Cooperation (collaborative action), Reciprocity (bidirectional value exchange), Mutualism (benefit extending to the wider community or ecosystem beyond the participants), and Regeneration (actions that demonstrably improve ecological or social conditions). The currency — **UBECrc** — is recorded on the **Stellar blockchain**, which provides a transparent, tamper-resistant public ledger that no single party, including Erdpuls itself, can alter.

The economic model is designed to make two commitments operationally real: first, that those with the deepest knowledge of place can always participate regardless of financial means (through the Collective Threshold Model's four participation pathways, including a Supported Rate); and second, that voluntary contributions — planting a hedgerow, teaching a skill, translating a pattern card — are as economically legible as paid transactions.

## 4. The Six Pedagogical Models

Erdpuls combines six distinct theoretical and methodological models into a unified pedagogical architecture. None is used in isolation; each is explicitly interwoven with the others across all 20 Living Experience Guides and all five OER Layer publications. The Master Index (v1.4) maps each model to all documents in which it appears.

### 4.1 Three-Stream Pedagogy (Head / Hands / Heart)

The foundational pedagogical principle of the entire programme. Every workshop and activity is designed from the outset to engage all three streams simultaneously. The **Head** stream encompasses conceptual understanding, data interpretation, and pattern recognition. The **Hands** stream encompasses direct making, measuring, repairing, building, and growing. The **Heart** stream encompasses felt experience, values reflection, empathy, and aesthetic attention to the living world.

The philosophical root is Rudolf Steiner's triune model of the human being (*Denken / Fühlen / Wollen*, or Thinking / Feeling / Willing), which provides the design logic for session structure: activities are not merely cognitively accessible but bodily and affectively engaging. This is simultaneously a Waldorf-derived pedagogical approach and a Goethean scientific commitment. In practice, the Three-Stream principle produces the core operational rule of the programme: **"Body first, then instrument"** — participants encounter every phenomenon with their senses before any measuring device is introduced.

### 4.2 The 4A-Pathway (Awareness — Acknowledgment — Attitude — Action)

The 4A-Pathway is the structural spine of every educational sequence in the programme. It describes a four-stage developmental arc that every participant moves through in every session, from initial sensory encounter to concrete documented action.

In the **Awareness** stage, participants experience direct sensory encounter with the phenomenon under study — soil texture, local plant diversity, the proxemic feeling of different spatial arrangements, or the comparison between a conventional and a reciprocal economic transaction. In the **Acknowledgment** stage, participants recognise that what they have encountered matters — personally, locally, and globally — making the connection between their immediate experience and larger systems. In the **Attitude** stage, values reflection takes place: participants examine what their direct experience means for how they want to live, what they believe, and what they are willing to do. In the **Action** stage, participants produce a concrete, documented output — a repair, a planted seedling, a contributed dataset, a designed token economy, a named pattern card — that does not disappear when the workshop ends.

The 4A-Pathway maps directly to the Brandenburg BNE design competency framework (all 12 Transfer 21 Gestaltungskompetenzen) and is further calibrated to Anthroposophical developmental theory: OER Guide 01 (Grades 1–4) targets will-forces through embodied discovery; Guide 02 (Grades 5–8) engages awakening causal reasoning; Guide 03 (Grades 9–12) engages the emergence of individual ethical judgment. The pathway is equally the design logic for the adult and cross-border target group guides.

### 4.3 Christopher Alexander's Pattern Language

Derived from Alexander's *A Pattern Language* (1977), this model holds that every healthy place has recurring, interconnected design patterns that emerge from close observation rather than being imposed from outside. Erdpuls applies this in three interrelated ways.

First, the **concentric ring observation method** structures every field session into five rings of attention, each defined by proxemic distance: Ring 0 (body calibration, the participant's own sensory instrument), Ring 1 (intimate contact, 0–45 cm), Ring 2 (middle ground, 45 cm–1.2 m), Ring 3 (horizon zone, 1.2–3.6 m), and Ring 4 (bioregional boundary, 3.6 m and beyond to the landscape scale). Second, **Pattern cards** are the tangible output of each workshop session — participants name, document, and translate their observations into recurring patterns, which are accumulated and archived over time. Third, an **annual Pattern Language Assembly** held each January synthesises a year's workshop outputs into a coherent, place-specific pattern language document that belongs to the community and is published under OER licence.

The Pattern Discovery Toolkit (Parts 1–5, v1.3), its Appendices (v1.2), and the Pattern Language Assembly Guide constitute the theoretical and operational documentation for this model.

### 4.4 Goethean Observation (Phänomenologische Methode)

Drawn from Goethe's scientific method (*Anschauende Urteilskraft*, or intuitive perception), this model guides participants to observe phenomena without premature categorisation. Participants are asked to hold what they see, hear, smell, touch, and intuit as primary data — complete and valid in itself — before reaching for measurement instruments or classification systems. This approach is simultaneously a scientific commitment (the body as a sensing instrument of equal dignity to an electronic sensor) and a pedagogical one (building genuine familiarity with the living world before abstracting from it).

In the Soil Laboratory, Goethean observation is operationalised as the **Sensor Dialogue**: every measurement exists as a pair — *Mein Wert* (the participant's sensory estimate) and *Sensor-Wert* (the instrument reading). These are not in competition; they are two different and complementary ways of knowing the same phenomenon. The dialogue between them is where learning happens. The approach grounds BNE criterion 4.3.1 (reflecting one's own values and assumptions) in direct practice.

### 4.5 Proxemics Theory (Edward T. Hall)

Based on Hall's *The Hidden Dimension* (1966), Proxemics is the study of how spatial distance between people shapes the quality and depth of interaction. Hall identified four distance zones — intimate (0–45 cm), personal (45 cm–1.2 m), social (1.2–3.6 m), and public (3.6 m+) — each associated with different sensory regimes, emotional qualities, and communicative possibilities.

Proxemics is integrated into the Erdpuls programme at three levels. At the **environmental design** level, campus zones A–E are deliberately designed with proxemic intent — Zone B (the outdoor soil laboratory) is intimate-to-personal, supporting maximum sensory contact; Zone E (the Heritage Hub and community kitchen) is personal-to-intimate, supporting storytelling and relationship. At the **pedagogical level**, the concentric ring structure of the observation method maps directly onto Hall's distance zones, ensuring that each ring activates a qualitatively different sensory register. At the **cross-cultural level** — particularly important in the German-Polish border context — the programme explicitly addresses the fact that proxemic norms differ between Northern European and Central-Eastern European cultural traditions, and facilitates these differences as a learning resource rather than an obstacle.

The full Proxemic Integration document (v1.2) covers both English and German versions and constitutes the theoretical expansion of Section 1.5 of the Pattern Discovery Toolkit.

### 4.6 The Four-Element Token Economy

The token economy is not merely an economic instrument; it is a **pedagogical model** through which participants learn Reciprocal Economics by living and designing it. The four elements — Cooperation, Reciprocity, Mutualism, and Regeneration — function simultaneously as currency denominations, as ecological principles, and as evaluation criteria for one's own and the community's actions.

The Token Economy Living Guides (five guides, EN v1.2 and DE v1.2) provide age- and context-differentiated workshop designs for all five target groups. In workshop settings, participants first experience a simulated conventional market economy (Round 1: sociofugal spatial arrangement, individual transactions, scarcity) and then a reciprocal economy (Round 2: sociopetal arrangement, collaborative exchange, shared commons). The bodily, spatial experience of the difference — before any conceptual explanation is offered — is the primary pedagogical move. The four elements are then named, mapped to real activities, and recorded on physical token cards. These records ultimately enter the blockchain, making visible a form of value that conventional accounting renders invisible.

The UBECrc token currency is implemented on the Stellar blockchain. The architecture is designed; implementation is scheduled for Phase 1 (2026–2027).

## 5. Five Target Groups

All 20 Living Experience Guides and all OER Layer documents are differentiated across five target groups, each with specific developmental considerations, session lengths, and facilitation adaptations.

**Children and Youth** (school groups, informal learners, primarily Grades 5–7 as core audience, with OER guides extending from Grades 1–12) receive the most structured scaffolding, with Goethean first encounter and embodied discovery as primary modes. **Adults and Families** (mixed-age community participants) engage through the full workshop protocol with greater autonomy and capacity for values reflection. **Elders and Intergenerational Groups** participate through Wisdom Circles, Memory Market events, and knowledge-transfer formats in which elder local knowledge — of species, landscape change, and traditional crafts — is treated as primary research data. **Artists and Researchers** engage through the Artist-in-Residence programme and extended Citizen Science projects, with the most open-ended programme design and the greatest emphasis on the reciprocal economics of knowledge contribution. **Cross-Border German-Polish Groups** receive trilingual (DE/PL/EN) programming that explicitly incorporates the proxemic and cultural differences of the German-Polish Oder-Neisse border region as educational content.

---

## 6. Campus Architecture — Five Zones

The 5,000 m² campus is structured into five pedagogical zones, each with a defined proxemic character that matches its educational purpose.

**Zone A** (Precious Plastic and Repair Workshop) operates at personal-to-intimate proxemic distance and is the site of hands-on fabrication, repair, and materials transformation. **Zone B** (Garden and Outdoor Soil Laboratory) operates at intimate-to-personal distance and is the site of maximum sensory contact with soil, plants, and the living ecosystem. **Zone C** (Digital Lab: IoT, Arduino, senseBox) operates at personal distance and is the site of technical construction, sensor building, and data work. **Zone D** (Documentation and Fabrication: 3D printing, laser cutting, design) operates at personal-to-social distance and is the site of design, review, and OER production. **Zone E** (Heritage and Community Hub: Erzählcafé, Wisdom Circle, Community Kitchen) operates at personal-to-intimate distance and is the site of storytelling, shared meals, intergenerational encounter, and fire circle rituals.

Heritage renovation is an explicit educational content area across all zones: the campus buildings' considerable architectural heritage significance means that the acts of restoring them — traditional bricklaying, lime plastering, material preservation — are integrated into the sustainability literacy curriculum alongside soil science and sensor building.

## 7. Document Ecosystem — Complete Inventory

The project has produced **19 operational documents** (14 original layer documents + 5 OER Layer guides) plus 2 authoring standards documents in the `standards/` folder, totalling approximately **120,000+ words** across six document layers.

**Layer 1: Theoretical Foundation** comprises the Pattern Discovery Toolkit (Parts 1–5, ~6,850 words, v1.3), the Pattern Discovery Toolkit Appendices A–D (~10,000 words, v1.2), and the Proxemic Integration document (~9,650 words, v1.2). The Toolkit expanded significantly in February 2026 through major proxemic integration: a new Section 1.5 and rewritten Part 5.

**Layer 2: Workshop Guides** comprises 20 Living Experience Guides across four thematic series, each differentiated for all five target groups: the Questions to the Soil series (~14,560 words), the Token Economy series (~13,200 words), the Bioregion Mapping series (~12,740 words), and the BNE Quality Framework series (~10,120 words). All 20 guides are complete in English at v1.2.

**Layer 3: Operational Infrastructure** comprises the Facilitator's Implementation Handbook (~4,750 words) and the Pattern Language Assembly Guide (~3,840 words).

**Layer 4: Campus and Equipment** comprises the Soil Laboratory Concept in English, the Soil Laboratory Concept in German, and the Soil Laboratory Shopping List (XLSX, 77 line items).

**Layer 5: Institutional Documentation** comprises the BNE Quality Assessment and Leitbild (German, February 2026, 20+ pages, the formal compliance document) and the Brandenburg BNE Quality Catalog (MLUK Brandenburg, April 2023, the reference standard).

**Layer 6: OER Publication Layer** comprises five audience-differentiated guides: Learning Guide 01 (Grades 1–4), Learning Guide 02 (Grades 5–8), Learning Guide 03 (Grades 9–12), the Teachers' Guide (Guide 04), and the Citizen Scientist Handbook (Guide 05). All five are complete in English at v1.1 and publication-ready.

**Authoring Standards:** The ERDPULS_MARKDOWN_STANDARD_v1.1 and the OER Authoring Guide are maintained in the `standards/` folder and govern all document production. Python automation scripts for YAML front matter management, emoji-to-text conversion, and systematic formatting corrections have been developed against these standards.

**OER Metadata Package** (v1.2) provides complete submission-ready metadata for WirLernenOnline, Zenodo, OER Commons, Jointly.info, and eu-citizen.science platforms.

## 8. Soil Laboratory — Equipment and Budget

The soil laboratory concept employs a three-tier equipment architecture that operationalises the "body first, then instrument" principle at every stage of a session.

**Tier 1** uses human senses as primary instruments: eyes for colour and texture, hands for temperature and moisture, nose for organic matter content, and tongue-tip for pH estimation. No equipment is purchased for this tier. **Tier 2** introduces simple analogue tools: magnifying lenses, thermometers, pH indicator strips, infiltrometers, and soil texture ribbon test equipment. **Tier 3** introduces digital instruments: senseBox:edu IoT kits, Raspberry Pi sensor dashboards, and USB endoscope cameras for soil profile documentation.

The Einkaufsliste (Shopping List, February 2026 pricing) contains 77 line items across 14 procurement sources, organised into four procurement phases totalling **€4,058.50** plus **€93.00 per year** in consumables.

| Phase | Scope | Budget |
|---|---|---|
| Phase 1 | Core field equipment (immediate) | €525.50 |
| Phase 2 | Reference materials and extended measurement | €660.00 |
| Phase 3 | Digital layer (IoT, LoRaWAN, tablets) | €2,298.00 |
| Phase 4 | Professional additions (long-term) | €575.00 |
| **Annual consumables** | pH strips, print costs, gloves, pencils | **€93.00/yr** |
| **TOTAL (Phases 1–4)** | 77 line items, 14 sources | **€4,058.50** |

Significant DIY potential exists: colour reference cards, sorting plates, Berlese funnels, sensor nodes, and sample bags can all be produced in Erdpuls workshops (Zones A–D), reducing purchased cost.

## 9. BNE Quality Compliance

The programme is assessed against the **Brandenburg BNE Quality Catalog** (Qualitätskatalog für BNE außerschulischer Anbieterinnen und Anbieter, MLUK Brandenburg, April 2023), which comprises 69 quality criteria across 7 quality areas. The formal self-evaluation document is the *BNE-Qualitätsbewertung und Leitbild* (February 2026).

### Overall Compliance Result

| Quality Area | Title | Fully Met | Partial | Planned | Min. Req. Met? |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Goals and Target Groups | 4 / 4 | — | — | Yes |
| 2 | Approach | 3 / 3 | — | — | Yes |
| 3 | Methods | 11 / 13 | 2 | — | Yes |
| 4 | Design Competencies (Gestaltungskompetenz) | 12 / 12 | — | — | Yes |
| 5 | Quality Development | 6 / 7 | 1 | — | Yes |

| 7 | Organisational Conditions | 10 / 14 | 2 | 2 | Yes |
| **TOTAL** | | **49 / 57 (86%)** | **6** | **2** | **Yes — all 7 areas** |

### Particular Strengths

All four sustainability dimensions (ecological, economic, social, cultural) are fully integrated across all documents and guides. All 12 Transfer 21 Gestaltungskompetenzen are addressed (the minimum requirement is one). Eight UN SDGs are confirmed at Tier 1 and 2 evidence level: SDG 3, 4, 6, 10, 11, 13, 15, 17. The token economy makes the Leitbild's values measurable in day-to-day operations.

### Known Development Areas

Formal participant evaluation instruments (BNE criterion 5.2.2) are planned for Phase 2. External impact evaluation (5.2.3) is planned for Phase 3. Catering infrastructure — the community kitchen in Zone E — is planned for Phase 3. Cycling route descriptions and parking information (7.4.1) are currently in development.
